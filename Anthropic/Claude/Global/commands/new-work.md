# Step 1. Clean up whatever we were working on last
- Check the current branch, if there are uncommited changes, commit them if the commits make sense to go on the existing branch.
- If you commited existing work, check to see there is a PR for it if there is not one already. If there is not one, ask the user if they want you to create one.

# Step 2. Start a new branch
- Prompt the user for a description of the new work and use their response to create an appropriate branch to work on.
