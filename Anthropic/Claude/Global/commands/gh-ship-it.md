description: Commit uncommitted changes and create PR if needed

- If we are on the "main" branch, make a new branch to commit changes to. Never commit to the "main" branch.
- Commit any uncommitted changes
- Create a PR for the work that was committed if one does not exist for the current branch

Format your output as follows:
```

SHIP IT STATUS:
(branch and commit actions taken)
PR STATUS:
(PR creation or existing PR info)
--------------------------------------
```
