- If we are on the "main" branch, make a new branch to commit changes to. Never commit to the "main" branch.
- Commit any uncommitted changes
- Create a PR for the work that was committed if one does not exist for the current branch
- Let the user know what you did for the first two steps, if anything, then continue
